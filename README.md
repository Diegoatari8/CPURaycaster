# CPURaycasterUnity
 Raycasting Render experiment in Unity
 Done in Unity 2019.3.9f1.

This was done just as an experiment,i know there are lots of more efficient ways of doing this,and as this is my first time i used simple raycasts.
I hope you can find this useful,and if you find any way to enhance or optimize this,please let me know. Thanks!
