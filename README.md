# CPURaycasterUnity
 Raycasting Render experiment in Unity
 Done in Unity 2019.3.9f1.

This was done just as an experiment,i know there are lots of more efficient ways of doing this (Like Compute shaders with actual Ray Tracing),but i made this as my first time making a custom render method like this.
I hope you can find this useful,and if you find any way to enhance or optimize this,please let me know. Thanks!

# Functionality
-Main Render Ray (Color only)

-Shadow Ray

-Reflection Ray

# Planned additions

-Texture support for render ray

-Higher resolution support (as of now it only works in 64x64,if set to higher or lower the result is distorted)
